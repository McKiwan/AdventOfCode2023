# Advent Of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual online programming challenge that takes place during the month of December. Created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), it consists of a series of daily coding puzzles starting from December 1st until December 25th.  

## Description

The challenges vary in difficulty and cover a wide range of algorithms and problem-solving techniques, making it an engaging and educational event for programmers of all skill levels.
<br/><br/>
For this year I choose to code in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and you can check my different solutions for each days.
